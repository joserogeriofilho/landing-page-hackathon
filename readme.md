<strong>NestReady Hackathon</strong>
# Landing Page Example
This project shows the design and web development of a hypothetical landing page with tips for first-time home buying people, an interesting content for a large group of the NestReady users. The page shows content related illustrations and uses the colors of the company. The website is truly web responsive showing different layout structures (margins, dimensions and elements disposal) for different devices (desktops, tablets and phones).
