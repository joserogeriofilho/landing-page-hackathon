<strong>VanHack's Hackathon: NestReady</strong>
# Landing Page Proposal
This project is a landing page design proposal for first-time home buyers, a significant portion of NestReady's customers. The page shows theme related illustrations and uses the colors of the target company brand. The page is truly web responsive showing different layout structures such as margins, dimensions and elements disposal for different device sizes (desktops, tablets and phones).
<br/>
This project was developed in an one day hackathon organized by VanHack as part of the NestReady job selection process.
